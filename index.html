        <p>Walter white, also known as Heisenberg was a chemistry genius, but worked as a chemistry teacher in an Albequerque, New Mexico high school. Walter was diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial security, Walter chose to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascend to power in this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as Walter's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.
